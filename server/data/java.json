        "question": "What is Java?",
        "answer": "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main features of Java?",
        "answer": "The main features of Java include object-oriented, platform-independent, simple, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, robust, multithreaded, interpreted, high performance, distributed, and dynamic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between JDK and JRE?",
        "answer": "JDK, or Java Development Kit, is a package for developers, which includes development tools such as compiler and debugger. JRE, or Java Runtime Environment, is a runtime environment for executing Java applications, including JVM, core libraries, and other supporting files."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is JVM and is it platform independent?",
        "answer": "JVM, or Java Virtual Machine, is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive Java applications. It converts Java bytecode into machine code. JVM is platform-dependent, as its implementation differs from one system to another, but the Java bytecode it executes is platform-independent."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between an array and an ArrayList in Java?",
        "answer": "An array is a fixed-size data structure, while ArrayList is a dynamic-size collection class. An array can hold both primitives and objects, whereas ArrayList can only hold objects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is inheritance in Java?",
        "answer": "Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one object acquires the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It's an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the concept of polymorphism in Java.",
        "answer": "Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is method overloading and method overriding in Java?",
        "answer": "Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their parameter lists are different. Method overriding is when a child class redefines the same method as declared in its parent class."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are interfaces in Java?",
        "answer": "An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods. Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction in Java and can be used to achieve loose coupling."
